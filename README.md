# Reality2.ai Website

This was created using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), with the graphics library [Fomantic UI](https://github.com/roycdaviesuoa/svelte-fomantic-ui) using the [vite](https://vite.dev/) framework.

The main WebApp is in the webapp folder.  You make changes there, then run the build script which uses [yarn build](https://yarnpkg.com) to create the runtime version, and then copies the resulting files into the correct place for github.
