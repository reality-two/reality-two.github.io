        We humans build <Link href="https://simplyputpsych.co.uk/psych-101-1/what-is-a-schema-in-psychology" target="_blank">cognitive frameworks</Link> in our minds to represent and help understand the complexities of the world around us.  These simplified representations of reality help us to explain our observations and are constantly being revised and adapted as new information comes to light.

        Oftentimes, we seek to draw parallels between something we already know and the new information we are trying to make sense of.  To do this, we use metaphors.

        For human-made tools, this metaphor becomes the language between the designer and the tool user.  Well-designed tools embody the natural understandings and cognitive and physical capabilities of people, in other words, <Link href="https://calmtech.com/" target="_blank">'Calm Technology'</Link>.

        A tool that is designed for driving a spiky piece of metal into a piece of wood to secure it to another, will likely be heavy at one end, have a handle that can be grasped, and be strong enough to take the blows.  The <Link href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323773021_'Affordance'_-_what_does_this_mean" target="_blank">natural affordance</Link> is so strong that a human picking up such a tool will likely start looking for things to hammer.

        This <Link href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267487031_Metaphors_in_Conceptual_Design" target="_blank">metaphor-as-a-language</Link> has been vital in the design of digital technologies.  How many people really understand how a mobile phone works, for example, let alone the Internet and cell networks that connect them all together?

        In the world of personal computers, the <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor" target="_blank">Desktop Metaphor</Link> has served us well, providing a conceptualisation of the inner gubbings of a networked computer since the days of Xerox Parc.  Even mobile devices use a variation of that metaphor, with icons, documents, filing systems, keyboards, and trash cans.

        However, with the emergence of <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_computing">spatial computing</Link> and everyday <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality">Mixed Reality</Link>, is this metaphor finally going to be deemed ineffective as a language between digital tool designers and their users?

        As people carry multiple devices with them, using them when out and about, with interaction via natural language and gestures; we are entering a new paradigm embodied by the 'Objects and Actors Metaphor'.
