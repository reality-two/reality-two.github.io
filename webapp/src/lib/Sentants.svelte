            The core of Reality2 is its functionality built on many small, independent elements called 'Sentient Digital Agents' that can sense the digital and physical environments around them.

            We also call Sentants 'Bees', that can work together in 'Swarms'.  Sentants can be programmed (given 'Behaviours') and have their functionality extended using 'Plugins' or 'Antennae' using the bee metaphor.

            A key guideline is that data is to be stored close to its source (with encrypted backups elsewhere as required).  This means that your data is quite literally 'on you', in the devices you wear and carry.  But don't worry, if you lose them, others won't be able to access your personal information.

            Each Sentant (or Bee) has a range of properties, namely it is: Programmeable, Immutable (can't be changed once created), Persistant (exists and 'runs' until it is removed), Unique (only one in the world) and Consistent (it is perceived the same regardless of the visualiser).

            Sentants / Bees are set up through loading a script to a Reality2 Node.  These scripts can be exchanged with others to <Link href="https://github.com/reality-two/reality2-definitions" target="_blank">share functionality</Link>, and even build up whole libraries of capability.

            Swarms of Sentants on Reality2 nodes have the emergent property of the 'Objects and Actors' metaphor.
