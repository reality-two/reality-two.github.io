            The core of Reality2 is built on Sentient Digital Agents, or ‘Sentants,’ which are small, independent elements that can sense the digital and physical environments around them. These Sentants, also known as ‘Bees,’ can work together in ‘Swarms’ to achieve complex tasks.        </Text>

            Sentants can be programmed with specific ‘Behaviours’ and have their functionality extended using ‘Plugins’ or ‘Antennae,’ continuing the bee metaphor. A key principle is that data is stored close to its source (with encrypted backups elsewhere as needed). This means your data is literally ‘on you’—in the devices you wear and carry. But don’t worry, if you lose these devices, others won’t be able to access your personal information.

            Each Sentant (or Bee) has a range of properties:
            <ul style="line-height: 1.4;">
                <li><strong>Immutable</strong>: Once created, its core cannot be changed.</li>
                <li><strong>Programmable</strong>: It can be customized for specific tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique</strong>: Each one is distinct and one-of-a-kind.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent</strong>: It behaves the same no matter how it is viewed.</li>
                <li><strong>Extensible</strong>: New features can be added through third-party plugins.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent</strong>: It remains active until it is removed.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: It communicates by sending and receiving messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Opaque</strong>: Without your personal keys, encryption keeps access limited.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptive</strong>: It understands its environment and adjusts accordingly.</li>
            </ul>

            Sentants are set up by loading a script onto a Reality2 Node. These scripts can be exchanged with others to share functionality, even building up entire libraries of capabilities (see the Marketplace tab above). When Sentants work together in Swarms, they bring the ‘Objects and Actors’ metaphor to life, creating an emergent, dynamic experience in Reality2.

            The core of Reality2 is its functionality built on many small, independent elements called 'Sentient Digital Agents' that can sense the digital and physical environments around them.

            We also call Sentants 'Bees', that can work together in 'Swarms'.  Sentants can be programmed (given 'Behaviours') and have their functionality extended using 'Plugins' or 'Antennae' using the bee metaphor.

            A key guideline is that data is to be stored close to its source (with encrypted backups elsewhere as required).  This means that your data is quite literally 'on you', in the devices you wear and carry.  But don't worry, if you lose them, others won't be able to access your personal information.

            Each Sentant (or Bee) has a range of properties, namely it is: Programmeable, Immutable (can't be changed once created), Persistant (exists and 'runs' until it is removed), Unique (only one in the world) and Consistent (it is perceived the same regardless of the visualiser).

            Sentants / Bees are set up through loading a script to a Reality2 Node.  These scripts can be exchanged with others to <Link href="https://github.com/reality-two/reality2-definitions" target="_blank">share functionality</Link>, and even build up whole libraries of capability.

            Swarms of Sentants on Reality2 nodes have the emergent property of the 'Objects and Actors' metaphor.
