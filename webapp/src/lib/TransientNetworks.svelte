            Reality2 is built on existing hardware and software infrastructure protocols, but reuses these in unusual ways to simplify the user experience to build the Objects and Actors metaphor.

            Digital authentication is one of life’s complexities. In the physical world, authentication is often built into the interaction itself. For example, when I pick up a ball, I don’t need to prove I can throw it—I’ll either be able to do it or not. Similarly, when I approach a display screen, I should be able to start my presentation with a simple flick of the wrist, without needing to connect cables or find the WiFi password.

            When making a purchase, my Reality2-enabled devices should automatically grant permission, without needing to swipe cards or enter PIN codes. Simply being present in the moment should be enough. The intelligent use of context—who I am, what I’m doing, who I’m with—helps make this possible.

            Transient Networks enable Reality2-powered devices to communicate seamlessly when they’re close together, without needing passwords, codes, or pairing. Each device has an ‘interactivity field.’ When these fields intersect, Sentient Digital Agents can interact. Authentication occurs at the agent level, not the network level.

            Technically, this works through protocols like BLE, Bluetooth, and WiFi, and sometimes others like LoRa, to create proximity-based fields for Transient Networks.

    One of life's complexities is digital authentication.  In the analogue world, this is much less common, with 'authentication' built into the very interaction itself.  I don't need to prove I can throw a ball before I pick it up, I will just be able to do it, or not.

    Similarly, when I walk up to a display screen, I should be able to put up my slidedeck presentation with the flick of the wrist, without first having to wrangle cables or find out the WiFi password.

    Or, when I want to purchase something in a shop, the Point of Sale machine should be able to get permission from the Reality2 enabled devices I am wearing or carrying without having to go through the complexities of swiping cards and PIN codes.

    Me, just being there in that moment, should be enough.  The intelligent use of context (who I am, what I am doing, who I am with, what I typically do here, at this time, etc) is a powerful tool for building Calm Technologies.

    Transient Networks allow Reality2 empowered devices to interact when they are close enough together without having to first connect with passwords, codes or pairing.

    Imagine that each device has around it an interactivity field.  When fields intersect, the Sentient Digital Agents can interact.  So, authentication occurs at the Digital Agent level, not the network level.

    Technically, Reality2 empowered devices use a combination of BLE, Bluetooth and WiFi (and sometimes other protocols such as LoRa) to implement the concept of proximity fields for Transient Networks.
